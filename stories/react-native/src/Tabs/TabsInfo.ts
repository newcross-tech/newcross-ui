const DESCRIPTION =
  'A segmented control/tabs component is a linear set of two or more segments, each of which functions as a mutually exclusive button. Within the control, all segments are equal in width. \n' +
  'They are typically styled as a toggle and used to switch between alternative views of similar or related content. ';

const DO = [
  'Limit the number of segments to improve usability. Wider segments are easier to tap. A segmented control should have 2 segments in app and a maximum of five on web.',
  'Keep segment content size consistent. Because all segments have equal width, it doesnâ€™t look great if content fills some segments but not others.',
  'The divider is only shown between non-sellected segments.',
  'Labels should be written in sentence case and should be clear and concise.',
];

const DONT = [
  'Avoid mixing text and images in a segmented control. Although individual segments can contain text or images, mixing the two in a single control can lead to a disconnected and confusing interface.',
  'Change the font styles or padding between elements, as shown above.',
