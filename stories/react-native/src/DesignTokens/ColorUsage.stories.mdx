# Color Usage

Color tokens in Newcross Healthcare applications are divided into **themes** and **elements**. This structured approach ensures consistency and simplifies the design and development process.

## Themes

Themes define the foundational colors and are categorized into semantic groups:

- **danger**: For errors, destructive actions, or alerts.
- **info**: Informational content, hints, or notifications.
- **neutral**: Base and neutral colors for backgrounds or text.
- **primary**: The primary brand color used prominently in the design.
- **secondary**: Supporting brand colors or accents.
- **success**: Indicators for positive actions, success messages, or validations.
- **tertiary**: Additional accent colors for non-critical content.
- **warning**: Alerts, cautions, or warnings.

Each theme category has shades ranging from lighter (`50`) to darker (`950`). These shades offer flexibility for usage in various contexts.

## Elements

**Elements** are semantic representations derived from themes. They map the theme colors to specific functional roles, ensuring that designers and developers use consistent colors for text, surfaces, icons, and borders.

### Text

Text elements provide semantic mappings for typography colors:

<DesignTokenDocBlock categoryName="Text" viewType="card" />

### Surface

Surface elements define background colors for different contexts:

<DesignTokenDocBlock categoryName="Surface" viewType="card" />

### Icon

Icon elements ensure consistent coloring for graphical icons:

<DesignTokenDocBlock categoryName="Icon" viewType="card" />

### Border

Border elements define consistent colors for outlines and borders:

<DesignTokenDocBlock categoryName="Border" viewType="card" />
