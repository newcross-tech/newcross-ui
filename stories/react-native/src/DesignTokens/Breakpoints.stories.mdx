# Breakpoints and Media Queries

Breakpoints define the responsiveness across different screen sizes. They provide a standard way to apply media queries and ensure consistency across the application.

## Available Breakpoints

The breakpoints available in the design system are:

## Media Query Utility

To simplify the use of media queries, we provide a utility function called `breakpoint`. This function enables you to create semantic media queries using the predefined breakpoints.

### How It Works

Under the hood, the `breakpoint` utility uses `max-width` media queries. This means that the styles defined for smaller breakpoints will override those defined for larger breakpoints if applied after them. To ensure the intended cascading effect:

**Always define breakpoints in descending order (`xl` → `lg` → `md` → `sm`).**

### Example Usage

Here’s how you can use the `breakpoint` function in your styled-components:

```typescript
const ResponsiveBox = styled.div`
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;

  ${breakpoint.xl`
    background-color: purple;
  `}

  ${breakpoint.lg`
    background-color: yellow;
  `}

  ${breakpoint.md`
    background-color: green;
  `}

  ${breakpoint.sm`
    background-color: red;
  `}
`;
```
