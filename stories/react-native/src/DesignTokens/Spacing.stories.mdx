# Spacing

Spacing tokens define consistent values for margins, paddings, and positional offsets, helping to maintain a unified layout across the application.

## Why Use Spacing Tokens?

Spacing tokens standardize the design and implementation of spacing across the UI. They allow developers and designers to maintain consistent spacing patterns while ensuring responsiveness and scalability.

## Responsiveness

To build responsive layouts efficiently, we recommend using the `Container` component. This component abstracts paddings, margins, gaps, and positioning, making it easier to apply spacing in a consistent and scalable manner.

**Why use `Container`?**

- Simplifies layout adjustments across breakpoints.
- Ensures design consistency by leveraging predefined spacing tokens.
- Reduces redundancy and hardcoded values in your components.

Refer to the `Container` documentation in Storybook for detailed guidance and examples.
