It allows users to swipe to see more content than what is currently in view. \nWe use our pagination dots to communicate how many ‘pages’/swipes the content has to view. It’s content would be used in the Onboarding screens, as well as Guidance pages relating to some sections (FlexiPay, AutoAssign etc) and guiding the users on the best way of using them.';
